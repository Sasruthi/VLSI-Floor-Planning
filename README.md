# VLSI-Floor-Planning Optimization
This project presents an automated approach to VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration) 
floorplanning, a critical step in integrated circuit design. Leveraging optimization algorithms 
including Simulated Annealing, Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Qlearning, the system iteratively refines chip layouts. Integration of machine learning models 
enables objective evaluation and informed decision-making throughout the optimization 
process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in generating 
high-quality chip layouts, accelerating design cycles, and improving overall chip 
performance. This framework offers a flexible and efficient solution for VLSI floorplanning, 
contributing to advancements in integrated circuit design methodologies.
